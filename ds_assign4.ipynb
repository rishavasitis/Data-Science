    "1. The purpose of the General Linear Model (GLM) is to analyze the relationship between one or more independent variables (predictors) and a dependent variable (outcome) by fitting a linear equation to the data. It is a flexible statistical framework that allows for the analysis of various types of data and can handle both continuous and categorical predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The key assumptions of the General Linear Model are:\n",
    "   a. Linearity: The relationship between the predictors and the outcome is linear.\n",
    "   b. Independence: The observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "   c. Homoscedasticity: The variability of the outcome variable is constant across all levels of the predictors.\n",
    "   d. Normality: The residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values) are normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In a GLM, the coefficients represent the estimated effect of each predictor on the outcome variable, while holding other predictors constant. The coefficients indicate the direction (positive or negative) and magnitude of the relationship. For example, a positive coefficient means that an increase in the predictor variable is associated with an increase in the outcome variable, while a negative coefficient means the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A univariate GLM involves analyzing a single dependent variable using one or more independent variables. It focuses on examining the relationship between one outcome and a set of predictors. On the other hand, a multivariate GLM involves analyzing multiple dependent variables simultaneously using one or more independent variables. It allows for the examination of relationships between multiple outcomes and predictors, taking into account their interdependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Interaction effects in a GLM occur when the relationship between two or more predictors and the outcome is not additive. It means that the effect of one predictor on the outcome depends on the value of another predictor. In other words, the relationship between predictors and the outcome is not simply the sum of their individual effects. Interaction effects can reveal complex relationships and provide insights into how the predictors interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Categorical predictors in a GLM are typically represented using dummy variables or indicator variables. Each category of the categorical predictor is converted into a binary variable (0 or 1). These variables are then included as predictors in the GLM. The coefficient associated with each dummy variable represents the difference in the mean outcome between that category and the reference category (which is usually encoded as 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The design matrix in a GLM is a matrix that represents the predictors used in the model. Each column of the design matrix corresponds to a predictor variable, including both continuous and categorical predictors. The design matrix helps in estimating the coefficients for each predictor and fitting the linear equation to the data. It is a crucial component of the GLM framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The significance of predictors in a GLM can be tested using hypothesis testing. The most common approach is to calculate the p-value associated with each predictor's coefficient. If the p-value is below a pre-specified significance level (often 0.05), it indicates that the predictor has a statistically significant effect on the outcome. However, it's important to consider the context and interpret the results in conjunction with other statistical measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Type I, Type II, and Type III sums of squares refer to different methods of partitioning the total variation in the outcome variable among the predictors in a GLM. The choice of sums of squares depends on the research question and the experimental design. \n",
    "   - Type I sums of squares sequentially test each predictor's unique contribution to the model while controlling for the other predictors.\n",
    "   - Type II sums of squares test the contribution of each predictor after adjusting for all other predictors in the model.\n",
    "   - Type III sums of squares test the contribution of each predictor while adjusting for all other predictors in the model, including interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Deviance in a GLM is a measure of the discrepancy between the observed data and the predicted values from the model. It quantifies how well the model fits the data. Lower deviance values indicate a better fit. Deviance is often used in hypothesis testing, such as comparing nested models or conducting likelihood ratio tests to assess the significance of predictors or the overall model."

    "11. Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to examine the relationship between a dependent variable (the outcome we want to predict or explain) and one or more independent variables (predictors or factors that may influence the outcome). Its purpose is to understand how changes in the independent variables are associated with changes in the dependent variable and to make predictions or draw inferences based on this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. The main difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression lies in the number of independent variables used. In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, whereas in multiple linear regression, there are two or more independent variables. Simple linear regression focuses on exploring the linear relationship between one predictor and the outcome, while multiple linear regression considers the combined effects of multiple predictors on the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. The R-squared value, also known as the coefficient of determination, represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in the regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that none of the variability is explained, and 1 indicates that all the variability is explained. A higher R-squared value suggests that the regression model provides a better fit to the data, indicating that a larger proportion of the outcome's variability is accounted for by the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, while regression aims to model and predict the dependent variable based on the independent variables. Correlation does not distinguish between dependent and independent variables, and it does not imply causation. On the other hand, regression analysis focuses on understanding the effect of independent variables on the dependent variable and provides a framework for prediction and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. In regression, coefficients represent the estimated impact or effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable. They indicate the magnitude and direction of the relationship. The intercept, or constant term, represents the estimated value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero. It is the value where the regression line intersects the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern of the data. They can strongly influence the regression analysis, pulling the regression line towards them and affecting the estimated coefficients. Handling outliers depends on the situation. One approach is to examine the data for data entry errors or measurement issues. If the outliers are genuine, they may be removed if they are determined to be influential or if they violate the assumptions of the regression analysis. Alternatively, robust regression methods can be used that are less sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is a standard method that aims to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values. It assumes that the independent variables are not highly correlated. On the other hand, ridge regression is a technique used to address multicollinearity (high correlation among predictors) by adding a penalty term to the regression equation. Ridge regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero, reducing their variance and potentially improving the model's performance when there is multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. Heteroscedasticity refers to the situation where the variability of the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) is not constant across the range of values of the independent variables. It violates one of the assumptions of regression, which assumes homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals). Heteroscedasticity can affect the model's reliability, as it may lead to biased coefficient estimates or incorrect standard errors. Various diagnostic tests and remedial techniques, such as transforming the data or using robust standard errors, can help address heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated with each other. It can cause issues in interpretation and estimation of the coefficients. To handle multicollinearity, one can assess the degree of correlation between predictors using techniques such as correlation matrices or variance inflation factor (VIF). If high multicollinearity is detected, potential solutions include removing one of the correlated predictors, combining them into a composite variable, or using dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis that allows for curved relationships between the predictors and the outcome by including higher-order polynomial terms (e.g., squared or cubed terms) in the model. It is used when the relationship between the predictors and the outcome appears to be nonlinear. By adding polynomial terms, the regression model can capture more complex patterns in the data beyond simple linear relationships. Polynomial regression can be helpful when a linear model fails to adequately explain the data or when there is prior knowledge suggesting a curvilinear relationship."

    "21. A loss function is a mathematical function that measures the discrepancy between the predicted output and the actual output in machine learning. Its purpose is to quantify the error or the \"loss\" of a machine learning model's predictions. The goal is to minimize the loss function, as a lower loss indicates better performance and accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. A convex loss function is one that forms a convex shape, meaning it is bowl-shaped and has only one minimum point. Non-convex loss functions, on the other hand, can have multiple local minimum points and do not form a smooth, bowl-shaped curve. Convex loss functions are preferred in machine learning because they guarantee convergence to the global minimum during optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. Mean squared error (MSE) is a commonly used loss function that measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. To calculate MSE, you take the difference between each predicted value and its corresponding actual value, square the differences, sum them up, and divide by the number of data points. It gives higher weight to larger errors because of the squaring operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. Mean absolute error (MAE) is a loss function that measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. Unlike MSE, MAE does not square the differences. To calculate MAE, you take the absolute difference between each predicted value and its corresponding actual value, sum them up, and divide by the number of data points. MAE gives equal weight to all errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. Log loss, also known as cross-entropy loss, is a loss function commonly used for binary classification problems. It measures the performance of a classification model by evaluating the probability distribution of the predicted class labels compared to the true class labels. Log loss penalizes confident and incorrect predictions more heavily. It is calculated by taking the negative logarithm of the predicted probability for the true class.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. The choice of an appropriate loss function depends on the specific problem and the nature of the data. For regression problems, MSE is commonly used when the focus is on minimizing large errors, while MAE is suitable when the emphasis is on all errors having equal importance. Log loss is commonly used for binary classification problems. The selection of the loss function should align with the objective and requirements of the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "27. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of a machine learning model. In the context of loss functions, regularization introduces additional terms that penalize complex models with large coefficients. These additional terms help control the model's complexity and prevent it from fitting the noise in the training data. Regularization helps balance the trade-off between model complexity and model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "28. Huber loss is a loss function that combines the characteristics of squared loss (MSE) and absolute loss (MAE). It is less sensitive to outliers compared to squared loss but still provides a differentiable loss function. Huber loss treats errors below a certain threshold as squared errors and errors above the threshold as absolute errors. This makes it more robust to outliers, as it reduces their impact on the model's optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. Quantile loss is a loss function used for quantile regression, which estimates the conditional quantiles of a target variable. It measures the difference between the predicted quantile and the actual value. The choice of quantile determines the specific quantile being estimated (e.g., median, 10th percentile, 90th percentile). Quantile loss allows for estimating different parts of the distribution, making it useful when modeling uncertainty or when focusing on specific percentiles of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "30. The main difference between squared loss and absolute loss is how they penalize prediction errors. Squared loss (MSE) penalizes larger errors more heavily due to the squaring operation, which can make it more sensitive to outliers. Absolute loss (MAE) treats all errors equally and does not amplify the effect of larger errors. Squared loss is differentiable and commonly used in optimization algorithms, while absolute loss is more robust to outliers but lacks differentiability. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the problem at hand."

    "31. An optimizer is an algorithm or method used in machine learning to adjust the parameters of a model in order to minimize a given loss function. Its purpose is to find the set of parameter values that optimize the model's performance by iteratively updating the parameters based on the observed errors or gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "32. Gradient Descent (GD) is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function, typically the loss function in machine learning. It works by iteratively adjusting the model's parameters in the direction of the steepest descent of the loss function. In other words, it follows the negative gradient of the loss function to update the parameters and gradually minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "33. There are different variations of Gradient Descent:\n",
    "   - Batch Gradient Descent: Updates the model's parameters using the gradients computed from the entire training dataset in each iteration.\n",
    "   - Stochastic Gradient Descent: Updates the parameters using the gradients computed from a single randomly selected training example at each iteration.\n",
    "   - Mini-batch Gradient Descent: Updates the parameters using the gradients computed from a small subset (batch) of the training data at each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "34. The learning rate in Gradient Descent determines the step size or the amount by which the parameters are updated in each iteration. Choosing an appropriate learning rate is important because it affects how quickly the algorithm converges and whether it converges to the global minimum or gets stuck in a suboptimal solution. The learning rate should be carefully tuned, balancing the trade-off between convergence speed and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "35. Gradient Descent can handle local optima in optimization problems because it uses the gradient information to iteratively update the parameters. By following the negative gradient, it continuously moves towards regions of lower loss. While it can get stuck in local optima, the algorithm can often escape them by taking smaller steps or by using variations of GD such as stochastic or mini-batch GD that introduce randomness or noise in the updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "36. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a variation of Gradient Descent that updates the parameters using the gradients computed from a single randomly selected training example at each iteration. It differs from traditional GD, which computes gradients from the entire training dataset. SGD is faster and more efficient for large datasets but introduces more noise and fluctuation in the parameter updates, which can result in a less stable convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "37. In Gradient Descent, the batch size refers to the number of training examples used in each iteration to compute the gradient and update the parameters. A larger batch size, such as using the entire dataset (batch GD), provides more accurate estimates of the gradient but requires more computational resources. Smaller batch sizes, like mini-batch GD or SGD, use subsets of the data and introduce more randomness and noise in the gradient estimates. The choice of batch size impacts the training speed, convergence stability, and generalization of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "38. Momentum is a concept used in optimization algorithms to accelerate convergence and overcome local optima. It introduces a \"velocity\" term that helps the parameters move more consistently in the direction of the gradients. The momentum term increases the update for parameters that consistently receive similar gradients over multiple iterations, leading to faster convergence along flatter dimensions and reduced oscillation around steep dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "39. The difference between batch GD, mini-batch GD, and SGD lies in the number of training examples used to compute the gradient and update the parameters in each iteration. Batch GD uses the entire training dataset, mini-batch GD uses a small subset (batch) of the data, and SGD uses a single randomly selected training example. Batch GD provides accurate gradient estimates but can be computationally expensive. Mini-batch GD balances accuracy and efficiency, while SGD is faster but introduces more noise in the gradient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "40. The learning rate affects the convergence of Gradient Descent by determining the step size of parameter updates in each iteration. If the learning rate is too high, the algorithm may overshoot the optimal solution and fail to converge. If it is too low, the algorithm may take excessively small steps and converge slowly. The appropriate learning rate depends on the specific problem and dataset and often requires tuning or the use of adaptive learning rate techniques to find a good balance."

    "41. Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of models. It introduces a penalty term to the model's objective function, which helps control the complexity of the model by discouraging overly complex or extreme parameter values. Regularization aims to find a balance between fitting the training data well and avoiding overemphasis on noise or irrelevant patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "42. L1 and L2 regularization are two common types of regularization techniques. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty to the objective function proportional to the absolute values of the model's coefficients. L2 regularization, also called Ridge regularization, adds a penalty proportional to the squared values of the coefficients. The key difference is that L1 regularization can lead to sparse solutions where some coefficients become exactly zero, while L2 regularization tends to shrink the coefficients towards zero without making them exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "43. Ridge regression is a linear regression technique that incorporates L2 regularization. It adds a penalty term to the regression objective function based on the squared magnitude of the coefficients. Ridge regression helps reduce the impact of multicollinearity (high correlation among predictors) by shrinking the coefficients towards zero, thus controlling their variance. It prevents overfitting and improves the stability of the regression estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "44. Elastic net regularization combines both L1 and L2 penalties in the regularization term. It adds a weighted sum of the absolute values (L1) and squared values (L2) of the coefficients to the objective function. Elastic net regularization aims to overcome the limitations of individual L1 or L2 regularization methods. It provides a flexible approach that can handle situations where there are both highly correlated predictors (L2 regularization is preferred) and the need for automatic feature selection (L1 regularization is preferred).\n",
    "\n",
    "45. Regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term that discourages extreme parameter values or complex models. Overfitting occurs when a model fits the training data too closely and captures noise or irrelevant patterns, resulting in poor performance on unseen data. Regularization encourages the model to find a simpler and more generalized representation of the underlying patterns, reducing the model's reliance on individual data points and noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "46. Early stopping is a technique related to regularization that involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation dataset during training. As the model trains, the performance on the validation set is continuously evaluated. Training is stopped early when the validation performance starts to degrade or reach a plateau. Early stopping helps prevent overfitting by finding the point where the model achieves good generalization without continuing to learn from the training data, which may lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "47. Dropout regularization is a technique commonly used in neural networks. It randomly deactivates (sets to zero) a portion of the neurons or their connections during each training iteration. By dropping out neurons, the network is forced to learn redundant representations and prevents the network from relying too heavily on specific neurons. Dropout regularization helps improve the network's generalization by reducing overfitting and encourages the network to learn more robust and distributed representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "48. Choosing the regularization parameter involves finding the right balance between model complexity and the amount of regularization applied. The optimal regularization parameter is often determined through techniques like cross-validation or grid search, where different values of the regularization parameter are tried and the performance of the model is evaluated. The choice of the regularization parameter depends on the specific problem, dataset, and the desired level of model complexity.\n",

    "49. Feature selection and regularization are related but distinct concepts. Feature selection aims to identify and choose the most relevant features or predictors for a model, excluding irrelevant or redundant ones. It involves explicitly selecting a subset of features. Regularization, on the other hand, imposes a penalty on the model's coefficients to control their magnitude and complexity. While regularization can indirectly lead to feature selection by shrinking some coefficients towards zero, it does not explicitly exclude features but rather reduces their influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "50. Regularized models strike a trade-off between bias and variance. Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. High bias models may underfit the data and have limited representational power. Variance, on the other hand, refers to the sensitivity of the model to small fluctuations in the training data, often resulting in overfitting. Regularization helps reduce variance by constraining the model's complexity, but it can slightly increase bias. The trade-off between bias and variance must be carefully managed to achieve an optimal balance for good generalization."

    "51. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In SVM, the goal is to find the best hyperplane that separates the data points into different classes. The hyperplane is chosen such that it maximizes the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "52. The kernel trick is a technique used in SVM to handle non-linearly separable data. It allows SVM to implicitly map the input data to a higher-dimensional feature space where it becomes linearly separable. The kernel function computes the inner products between the transformed data points in the higher-dimensional space without explicitly calculating the transformation. This way, the SVM can efficiently find the optimal hyperplane without explicitly dealing with the high-dimensional feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "53. Support vectors in SVM are the data points from the training set that lie closest to the decision boundary or within the margin. They are the critical data points that determine the position and orientation of the decision boundary. Support vectors play a crucial role in defining the decision boundary and contribute to the final classification or regression model. Unlike other data points, the support vectors have a direct influence on the decision boundary and model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "54. The margin in SVM is the separation or gap between the decision boundary and the support vectors. It represents the region around the decision boundary where new, unseen data points are classified. A wider margin indicates better generalization and lower risk of misclassification. SVM aims to find the hyperplane that maximizes this margin, as it is more robust to noise and provides better separation between classes. A larger margin allows for more confident and accurate predictions on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "55. Handling unbalanced datasets in SVM involves addressing the issue when one class has significantly more samples than the other. Techniques such as class weights, cost-sensitive learning, or adjusting the C-parameter can help mitigate the impact of imbalanced data. Modifying the class weights or cost parameter can give more importance to the minority class, ensuring that the SVM focuses on correctly classifying the minority class rather than just optimizing the overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "56. Linear SVM is used when the data can be separated by a straight line or hyperplane. It aims to find a linear decision boundary that best separates the data points into different classes. Non-linear SVM, on the other hand, is used when the data is not linearly separable. It employs the kernel trick to implicitly transform the data into a higher-dimensional space, where a linear decision boundary can separate the classes. This allows SVM to handle complex, non-linear relationships between predictors and the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "57. The C-parameter in SVM controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the misclassification of training examples. A smaller value of C makes the model more tolerant of misclassifications and focuses on finding a larger margin. A larger value of C makes the model more sensitive to misclassifications and aims to minimize errors even if it means a smaller margin. The choice of the C-parameter depends on the specific problem and the desired balance between margin size and training error.\n",
    "\n",
    "58. Slack variables are introduced in SVM to handle non-linearly separable data or data points that lie within or on the wrong side of the margin. Slack variables allow for some misclassifications by allowing data points to fall within the margin or even on the wrong side of the decision boundary. The introduction of slack variables relaxes the strict separation requirement, making SVM more flexible and accommodating in dealing with more complex or noisy datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "59. In SVM, the hard margin refers to the approach of finding the largest possible margin without allowing any misclassifications. It assumes that the data is perfectly separable. However, in real-world scenarios, data may not always be linearly separable. Soft margin SVM, on the other hand, introduces the concept of slack variables and allows for misclassifications within a margin. It provides more flexibility, accommodating for some degree of misclassification to handle overlapping or noisy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "60. In an SVM model, the coefficients associated with the support vectors are important for interpreting the model. These coefficients determine the contribution of each support vector to the decision boundary and classification. The sign and magnitude of the coefficients indicate the influence and direction of each support vector's contribution to the decision boundary. By examining the coefficients, one can understand which support vectors have the most impact on the model's predictions and how they affect the classification of new, unseen data points."

    "61. A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm that makes predictions by recursively splitting the data based on the values of input features. It represents decisions as a tree-like structure, where each internal node represents a feature and each leaf node represents a class or a prediction. The tree is built by finding the best splits that maximize the separation or purity of the classes in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "62. In a decision tree, splits are made to divide the data into subsets based on the values of a particular feature. The goal is to create splits that maximize the homogeneity or purity of the classes within each subset. The algorithm considers different possible splits based on different thresholds or conditions for the selected feature and chooses the split that results in the best separation of the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "63. Impurity measures, such as the Gini index and entropy, are used in decision trees to evaluate the homogeneity or purity of a set of data points. The Gini index measures the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen data point based on the class distribution in the subset. Entropy measures the level of disorder or uncertainty in the subset. Lower impurity values indicate more homogeneous subsets and are preferred when making splits in a decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "64. Information gain is a concept used in decision trees to measure the effectiveness of a split. It quantifies the reduction in impurity achieved by splitting the data based on a particular feature. Information gain is calculated by comparing the impurity of the parent node before the split with the impurity of the child nodes after the split. A higher information gain suggests a more informative feature for the split, as it brings more purity to the resulting subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "65. Missing values in decision trees can be handled by either ignoring the data point during the split or using surrogate rules to estimate its classification. If a data point has a missing value for the selected feature, it can be sent down both branches of the split, and the impurity measures are adjusted accordingly. This allows the algorithm to use other features to make decisions for the data point. Alternatively, the missing value can be considered as a separate category during the split.\n",
    "\n",
    "66. Pruning in decision trees is a process of reducing the complexity of the tree by removing or collapsing unnecessary branches or nodes. It helps prevent overfitting and improves the generalization of the model. Pruning can be done through pre-pruning, where the tree is built with a stopping criterion, or post-pruning, where the fully grown tree is pruned by removing nodes that do not contribute significantly to the accuracy or impurity reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "67. A classification tree is used for categorical or discrete target variables and aims to predict the class or category of a data point. It splits the data based on categorical features and assigns the majority class to each leaf node. A regression tree, on the other hand, is used for continuous or numerical target variables and aims to predict a value or quantity. It splits the data based on numerical features and assigns the average or mean value to each leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "68. Decision boundaries in a decision tree can be interpreted as the points where the splits occur. Each split creates a boundary that separates the data points with different feature values. The decision boundary is formed by combining multiple splits along the tree's path from the root to the leaf nodes. It represents the regions in the feature space where the tree assigns different classes or predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "69. Feature importance in decision trees measures the significance or contribution of each feature in the decision-making process of the tree. It indicates how much each feature influences the splits and the resulting predictions. Feature importance can be calculated based on different criteria, such as the number of times a feature is used for splitting, the reduction in impurity, or the information gain achieved by a feature. It helps identify the most informative features for making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "70. Ensemble techniques in machine learning combine multiple decision trees to create more accurate and robust models. Ensemble methods, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, use variations of decision trees to build a collection of models and aggregate their predictions. Each tree in the ensemble is trained on a different subset or with a different objective, and their predictions are combined to make the final prediction. Ensemble techniques leverage the diversity and collective wisdom of multiple trees to improve overall performance."
